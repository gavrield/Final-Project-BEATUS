### VR Game for Oculus Rift music based
#### Summary
For many years virtual reality has been a dream in the gaming world.
It's hard to believe that just a decade ago the Oculus Rift released their first prototype and
this whole area was so far away and undeveloped.
But today, the gaming world is undergoing significant change.
Combined with powerful and advanced consoles, virtual reality today is increasing market
share and also purchasing equipment is becoming more accessible and cheaper.
However, it is clear to everyone that playing in virtual reality gives the player the deepest
feeling he can get.
This is exactly why we chose to combine virtual reality into our project.
This summary describes the development of a virtual reality game called "Beat Us".
The main goal of the project is a virtual reality game based on artificial intelligence, AI, that
can analyze the music and display objects according to the beat.
It should be noted that such a game development is complex due to its engineering
challenge and resumes from today's market competitors in various consoles that we
reviewed during work.
The player will have to hit objects according to the handles he will hold, evading certain
objects and thus accumulate points with the goal of course being to accumulate as much as
possible and head the table.
The game is developed for PC as it is chosen from among the systemic alternatives due to
providing high level graphics and user experience accordingly.
